## Step 3: Set the properties of the True DBGrid Pro 6.0 control
 
In Visual Basic 6, select the True DBGrid Pro 6.0 control on your form and go to Properties window. Here you can set various properties of the control, such as:
 
- **DataMode**: This property determines whether the grid is bound or unbound. For this example, we will use bound mode, so set this property to "dbModeBound".
- **DataSource**: This property specifies the data source for the grid. For this example, we will use an ADO data control, so set this property to "Adodc1".
- **Recordset**: This property specifies the recordset for the grid. For this example, we will use a table from a Microsoft Access database, so set this property to "Adodc1.Recordset".
- **AllowAddNew**: This property determines whether the user can add new records to the grid. For this example, we will allow this feature, so set this property to "True".
- **AllowDelete**: This property determines whether the user can delete records from the grid. For this example, we will allow this feature, so set this property to "True".
- **AllowUpdate**: This property determines whether the user can edit records in the grid. For this example, we will allow this feature, so set this property to "True".
- **Columns**: This property allows you to customize the columns of the grid, such as their width, alignment, caption, format, etc. For this example, we will leave them as default.

## Step 4: Add an ADO data control to your form
 
In Visual Basic 6, go to Tools -> Components and check the box next to "Microsoft ADO Data Control 6.0 (OLEDB)". This will add the ADO data control to your toolbox. Then, drag and drop the control onto your form and resize it as needed.
 
## Step 5: Set the properties of the ADO data control
 
In Visual Basic 6, select the ADO data control on your form and go to Properties window. Here you can set various properties of the control, such as:

- **Name**: This property specifies the name of the control. For this example, we will use "Adodc1".
- **ConnectionString**: This property specifies the connection string for the database. For this example, we will use a Microsoft Access database named "Customers.mdb" located in the same folder as our project file, so set this property to "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=Customers.mdb;Persist Security Info=False".
- **RecordSource**: This property specifies the record source for the database. For 8cf37b1e13
