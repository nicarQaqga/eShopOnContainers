# How to Use NetBus (Hacking Software) 64 Bit to Control Remote Computers
  
NetBus is a notorious hacking software that allows you to remotely access and control any computer that runs Windows. It was created in 1998 by a Swedish programmer named Carl-Fredrik Neikter, and it has been used by hackers, pranksters, and cybercriminals ever since.
  
NetBus works by installing a server program on the target computer, which runs in the background and listens for commands from a client program on the hacker's computer. The hacker can then use the client program to perform various actions on the target computer, such as:

- Capturing screenshots and webcam images
- Playing sounds and displaying messages
- Stealing passwords and personal information
- Installing malware and viruses

NetBus is compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows, but you need to use the appropriate version of the server program for the target computer. In this article, we will show you how to use NetBus (Hacking Software) 64 Bit to control remote computers that run 64-bit Windows.

The download file is a ZIP archive that contains two executable files: netbus.exe and netbus64.exe. The netbus.exe file is the client program that you will use to control the target computer, and the netbus64.exe file is the server program that you will need to install on the target computer.
  
## Step 2: Install NetBus (Hacking Software) 64 Bit on the Target Computer
  
The next step is to install NetBus (Hacking Software) 64 Bit on the target computer. This is the most challenging part of the process, as you need to find a way to access the target computer and run the netbus64.exe file without being detected. There are several methods you can use to do this, such as:

- Sending an email with the netbus64.exe file as an attachment, and tricking the target user into opening it.
- Uploading the netbus64.exe file to a cloud storage service or a file-sharing website, and sending a link to the target user.
- Using a USB drive or a CD-ROM to copy the netbus64.exe file to the target computer, and running it manually or using autorun.
- Exploiting a vulnerability or a backdoor in the target computer's system or network, and remotely executing the netbus64.exe file.

Whichever method you choose, make sure that you disguise the netbus64.exe file as something harmless or legitimate, such as an image, a document, or a game. You can also use a tool like WinRAR or UPX to compress or encrypt the netbus64.exe file, making it harder for antivirus software to detect it.
  
Once you run the netbus64.exe file on the target computer, it will install itself as a service named "NetBus" and start running in the background. It will also create a registry entry in HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run that ensures that it will run every time the target computer starts up.
  
## Step 3: Connect to the Target Computer with NetBus (Hacking Software) 64 Bit
  
The final step is to connect to the target computer with NetBus (Hacking Software) 64 Bit using the netbus.exe file on your own computer. To do this, you need to know the IP address of the target computer, which you can obtain by using various tools or techniques, such as:
