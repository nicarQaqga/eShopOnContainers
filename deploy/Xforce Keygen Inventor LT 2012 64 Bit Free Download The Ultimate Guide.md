- Use the "Measure" command to measure distances, angles, areas, volumes, etc. in your model. You can also use the "Analyze" command to check for interferences, clearances, mass properties, etc. in your model.
- Use the "Render" command to create realistic images of your model with different materials, lighting, and backgrounds. You can also use the "Animation" command to create dynamic videos of your model with different views and motions.

These are just some of the many features and functions that Inventor LT 2012 offers. You can explore more by using the "Help" menu or the online tutorials and forums.
